# PeachPit
tl;dr - PeachPit is a productivity app created for video game enthusiasts. It is intended as a personal project to improve my programming skills.

When I was a kid, I saw the movie Kung Fu Panda. It contains a lot of food for thought that even adults can chew on, but there was one aspect that stuck with me the most:

One of the main characters of the film is called Shifu. He's a Kung Fu master who has tutored most powerful warriors in the land, but he struggles with his latest student, Po. Po is fat, unrefined, and clumsy, and Shifu believes that Po is incapable of becoming a competent warrior. When Shifu complains about this to his own mentor, Master Oogway, Oogway responds thusly:

"If you plant a peach seed, it will grow to be a peach tree. You may wish for an apple, or an orange, but you will get a peach. But a peach can still grow into a great tree... if you are willing to guide it. To nurture it." 
(paraphrased)

Shifu decides to change up his usual teaching style to better suit Po's strengths, allowing Po to unlock his hidden potential (that not even he himself was aware of) and ultimately save their home from invading forces.

Now, failure is rarely a life-or-death situation in this day and age, but Po is still a good stand-in for a lot of people. Many are dismissed as lazy or worthless purely because standard methods of motivation don't work on them. There're a lot of people like this, but I choose to target gamers for this project. The ultimate purpose of PeachPit is to appeal to gamers and to encourage them to improve themselves in a way that works with their natural inclinations, rather than against them.
